<h2>PREFACE<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[ix]</a></span><br />
<span style="font-size: 70%">TO</span><br />
THE MINSTREL.</h2>

<hr />


<p><span class="smcap"><big>T</big>he</span> design was, to trace the progress of a
Poetical Genius, born in a rude age, from
the first dawning of fancy and reason, till
that period at which he may be supposed capable
of appearing in the world as a <span class="smcap">Minstrel</span>,
that is, as an itinerant Poet and Musician;&mdash;a
character, which, according to the
notions of our fore-fathers, was not only respectable,
but sacred.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[x]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">I have</span> endeavoured to imitate <span class="smcap">Spenser</span>
in the measure of his verse, and in the harmony,
simplicity, and variety, of his composition.
Antique expressions I have avoided;
admitting, however, some old words, where
they seemed to suit the subject; but I hope
none will be found that are now obsolete, or
in any degree unintelligible to a reader of
English poetry.</p>

<p>To those, who may be disposed to ask,
what could induce me to write in so difficult
a measure, I can only answer, that it pleases
my ear, and seems, from its Gothic structure
and original, to bear some relation to
the subject and spirit of the Poem. It admits
both of simplicity and magnificence of
sound and of language, beyond any other
stanza that I am acquainted with. It allows<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi">[xi]</a></span>
the sententiousness of the couplet, as well as
the more complex modulation of blank verse.
What some critics have remarked, of its uniformity
growing at last tiresome to the ear,
will be found to hold true, only when the
poetry is faulty in other respects.</p>

<h3>BOOK FIRST.</h3>


<p class="stanzano">I.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i1"><span class="smcap"><big>A</big>h</span>! who can tell how hard it is to climb<br /></span>
<span class="i1">The steep, where Fame&#8217;s proud temple shines afar!<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Ah! who can tell how many a soul sublime<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Has felt the influence of malignant star,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And waged with Fortune an eternal war!<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Checked by the scoff of Pride, by Envy&#8217;s frown,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And Poverty&#8217;s unconquerable bar,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">In life&#8217;s low vale remote has pined alone,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then dropt into the grave, unpitied and unknown!<br /></span>
</div></div>


<p class="stanzano">II.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i1">And yet, the languor of inglorious days<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Not equally oppressive is to all.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Him, who ne&#8217;er listened to the voice of praise,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">The silence of neglect can ne&#8217;er appal.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">There are, who, deaf to mad Ambition&#8217;s call,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Would shrink to hear th&#8217; obstreperous trump of Fame;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Supremely blest, if to their portion fall<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Health, competence, and peace. Nor higher aim<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had He, whose simple tale these artless lines proclaim.<br /></span>
</div></div>


<p class="stanzano">III.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i1">This sapient age disclaims all classic lore;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Else I should here, in cunning phrase, display,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">How forth <span class="smcap">The Minstrel</span> fared in days of yore,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Right glad of heart, though homely in array;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">His waving locks and beard all hoary grey:<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And, from his bending shoulder, decent hung<br /></span>
<span class="i1">His harp, the sole companion of his way,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Which to the whistling wind responsive rung:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And ever as he went some merry lay he sung.<br /></span>
</div></div>


<p class="stanzano">IV.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i1">Fret not yourselves, ye silken sons of pride,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">That a poor Wanderer should inspire my strain.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">The Muses fortune&#8217;s fickle smile deride,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Nor ever bow the knee in Mammon&#8217;s fane;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">For their delights are with the village-train,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Whom Nature&#8217;s laws engage, and Nature&#8217;s charms:<br /></span>
<span class="i1">They hate the sensual, and scorn the vain;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">The parasite their influence never warms,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor him whose sordid soul the love of wealth alarms.<br /></span>
</div></div>


<p class="stanzano">V.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i1">Though richest hues the peacock&#8217;s plumes adorn,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Yet horror screams from his discordant throat.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Rise, sons of harmony, and hail the morn,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">While warbling larks on russet pinions float;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Or seek, at noon, the woodland scene remote,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Where the grey linnets carol from the hill.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">O let them ne&#8217;er, with artificial note,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">To please a tyrant, strain the little bill!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But sing what heaven inspires, and wander where they will.<br /></span>
</div></div>


<p class="stanzano">VI.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i1">Liberal, not lavish, is kind Nature&#8217;s hand;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Nor was perfection made for man below.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Yet all her schemes with nicest art are planned,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Good counteracting ill, and gladness woe.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">With gold and gems if Chilian mountains glow,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">If bleak and barren Scotia&#8217;s hills arise;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">There, plague and poison, lust and rapine grow;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Here, peaceful are the vales, and pure the skies,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And freedom fires the soul, and sparkles in the eyes.<br /></span>
</div></div>


<p class="stanzano">VII.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i1">Then grieve not, thou, to whom the indulgent Muse<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Vouchsafes a portion of celestial fire;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Nor blame the partial fates, if they refuse<br /></span>
<span class="i1">The imperial banquet, and the rich attire.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Know thine own worth, and reverence the lyre.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Wilt thou debase the heart which God refined?<br /></span>
<span class="i1">No; let thy heaven-taught soul to heaven aspire,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">To fancy, freedom, harmony, resigned;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ambition&#8217;s grovelling crew for ever left behind.<br /></span>
</div></div>


<p class="stanzano">VIII.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i1">Canst thou forego the pure ethereal soul<br /></span>
<span class="i1">In each fine sense so exquisitely keen,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">On the dull couch of Luxury to loll,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Stung with disease, and stupified with spleen;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Fain to implore the aid of Flattery&#8217;s screen,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Even from thyself thy loathsome heart to hide,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">(The mansion, then, no more of joy serene)<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Where fear, distrust, malevolence, abide,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And impotent desire, and disappointed pride?<br /></span>
</div></div>


<p class="stanzano">IX.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i1">O, how canst thou renounce the boundless store<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Of charms which Nature to her votary yields!<br /></span>
<span class="i1">The warbling woodland, the resounding shore,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">The pomp of groves, and garniture of fields;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">All that the genial ray of morning gilds,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And all that echoes to the song of even,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">All that the mountain&#8217;s sheltering bosom shields,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And all the dread magnificence of heaven,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O how canst thou renounce, and hope to be forgiven!<br /></span>
</div></div>


<p class="stanzano">X.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i1">These charms shall work thy soul&#8217;s eternal health,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And love, and gentleness, and joy, impart.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">But these thou must renounce, if lust of wealth<br /></span>
<span class="i1">E&#8217;er win its way to thy corrupted heart;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">For ah! it poisons like a scorpion&#8217;s dart;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Prompting the ungenerous wish, the selfish scheme,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">The stern resolve, unmoved by pity&#8217;s smart,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">The troublous day, and long distressful dream.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Return, my roving Muse! resume thy purposed theme.<br /></span>
</div></div>


<p class="stanzano">XI.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i1">There lived, in Gothic days, as legends tell,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">A shepherd-swain, a man of low degree;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Whose sires, perchance, in Fairyland might dwell,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Sicilian groves, or vales of Arcady;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">But he, I ween, was of the North Countrie:<br /></span>
<span class="i1">A nation famed for song, and beauty&#8217;s charms;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Zealous, yet modest; innocent, though free;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Patient of toil; serene amidst alarms;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Inflexible in faith; invincible in arms.<br /></span>
</div></div>


<p class="stanzano">XII.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i1">The shepherd-swain, of whom I mention made,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">On Scotia&#8217;s mountains fed his little flock;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">The sickle, scythe, or plough, he never swayed;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">An honest heart was almost all his stock;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">His drink the living water from the rock:<br /></span>

<span class="i0">O happy stroke, that bursts the bonds of clay,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Darts through the rending gloom the blaze of day,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And wings the soul with boundless flight to soar,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where dangers threat, and fear alarms no more!<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Transporting thought! here let me wipe away<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The tear of grief, and wake a bolder lay.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But ah! the swimming eye o&#8217;erflows anew,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor check the sacred drops to pity due;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lo! where in speechless, hopeless anguish, bend<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Mixed with yon drooping mourners, on her bier<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In silence shed the sympathetic tear.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Mingling in mortal combat on the plain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I sing. Ye Muses, favour my designs,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lead on my squadrons, and arrange the lines;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The flashing swords and fluttering wings display,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And long bills nibbling in the bloody fray;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Cranes darting with disdain on tiny foes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Conflicting birds and men, and war&#8217;s unnumbered woes!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i1">The wars and woes of heroes six feet long<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Who has not heard of Colchos&#8217; golden fleece,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Argo, manned with all the flower of Greece?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of Thebes&#8217; fell brethren, Theseus, stern of face,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Peleus&#8217; son, unrivalled in the race,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&AElig;neas, founder of the Roman line,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And William, glorious on the banks of Boyne?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who has not learned to weep at Pompey&#8217;s woes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And over Blackmore&#8217;s epic page to doze?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&#8217;Tis I, who dare attempt unusual strains,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of hosts unsung, and unfrequented plains;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The small shrill trump, and chiefs of little size,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And armies rushing down the darkened skies.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Where India reddens to the early dawn,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Winds a deep vale from vulgar eyes withdrawn:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bosomed in groves the lowly region lies,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And rocky mountains round the border rise.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Here, till the doom of Fate its fall decreed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The empire flourished of the pygmy-breed;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Here Industry performed, and Genius planned,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And busy multitudes o&#8217;erspread the land.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But now to these lone bounds if pilgrim stray,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tempting through craggy cliffs the desperate way,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He finds the puny mansion fallen to earth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Its godlings mouldering on th&#8217; abandoned hearth;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And starts, where small white bones are spread around,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&#8220;Or little footsteps lightly print the ground;&#8221;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While the proud crane her nest securely builds,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Chattering amid the desolated fields.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">But different fates befel her hostile rage,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While reigned, invincible through many an age,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The dreaded Pygmy: roused by war&#8217;s alarms,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Forth rushed the madding Mannikin to arms.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fierce to the field of death the hero flies;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The faint crane, fluttering, flaps the ground, and dies;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And by the victor borne (o&#8217;erwhelming load!)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With bloody bill loose-dangling marks the road.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And oft the wily dwarf in ambush lay,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And often made the callow young his prey;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">With slaughtered victims heaped his board, and smiled,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To visit the sire&#8217;s trespass on the child.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Oft, where his feathered foe had reared her nest,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And laid her eggs and household gods to rest,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Burning for blood, in terrible array,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The eighteen-inch militia burst their way:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All went to wreck; the infant foeman fell,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When scarce his chirping bill had broke the shell.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Loud uproar hence, and rage of arms arose,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the fell rancour of encountering foes;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hence dwarfs and cranes one general havoc whelms,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Death&#8217;s grim visage scares the pygmy realms.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not half so furious blazed the warlike fire<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of Mice, high theme of the Meonian lyre;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When bold to battle marched the accoutered Frogs,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the deep tumult thundered through the bogs.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pierced by the javelin-bulrush on the shore,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Here, agonizing, rolled the mouse in gore;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And there the frog (a scene full sad to see!)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shorn of one leg, slow sprawled along on three:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">He vaults no more with vigorous hops on high,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But mourns in hoarsest croaks his destiny.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And now the day of woe drew on apace,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A day of woe to all the pygmy-race,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When dwarfs were doomed (but penitence was vain)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To rue each broken egg, and chicken slain.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For roused to vengeance by repeated wrong,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From distant climes the long-billed legions throng:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From Strymon&#8217;s lake, Cayster&#8217;s plashy meads,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And fens of Scythia green with rustling reeds;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From where the Danube winds through many a land,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Mareotis laves the Egyptian strand,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To rendezvous they waft on eager wing,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And wait assembled the returning spring.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Meanwhile they trim their plumes for length of flight,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whet their keen beaks, and twisting claws, for fight;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Each crane the pygmy power in thought o&#8217;erturns,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And every bosom for the battle burns.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">When genial gales the frozen air unbind,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The screaming legions wheel, and mount the wind.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Far in the sky they form their long array,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And land and ocean stretch&#8217;d immense survey,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Deep, deep beneath; and triumphing in pride,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With clouds and winds commixed, innumerous ride;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&#8217;Tis wild obstreperous clangour all, and heaven<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whirls, in tempestuous undulation driven.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Nor less the alarm that shook the world below,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where marched in pomp of war the embattled foe;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where mannikins with haughty step advance,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And grasp the shield, and couch the quivering lance;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To right and left the lengthening lines they form,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And ranked in deep array await the storm.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">High in the midst the chieftain-dwarf was seen,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of giant stature, and imperial mien.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Full twenty inches tall, he strode along,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And viewed with lofty eye the wondering throng;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, while with many a scar his visage frowned,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bared his broad bosom, rough with many a wound<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of beaks and claws, disclosing to their sight<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The glorious meed of high heroic might.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">For with insatiate vengeance, he pursued,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And never-ending hate, the feathery brood.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Unhappy they, confiding in the length<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of horny beak, or talon&#8217;s crooked strength,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who durst abide his rage; the blade descends,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And from the panting trunk the pinion rends.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Laid low in dust the pinion waves no more,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The trunk, disfigured, stiffens in its gore.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What hosts of heroes fell beneath his force!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What heaps of chicken-carnage marked his course!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How oft, O Strymon, thy lone banks along,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Did wailing Echo waft the funeral song!<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And now from far the mingling clamours rise,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Loud and more loud rebounding through the skies.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From skirt to skirt of heaven, with stormy sway,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A cloud rolls on, and darkens all the day.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Near and more near descends the dreadful shade,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And now in battleous array displayed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On sounding wings, and screaming in their ire,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The cranes rush onward, and the fight require.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i1">The pygmy warriors eye, with fearless glare,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The host thick swarming o&#8217;er the burthened air:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thick swarming now, but to their native land<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Doomed to return a scanty, straggling band.&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When sudden, darting down the depth of heaven,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fierce on the expecting foe the cranes are driven.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The kindling phrensy every bosom warms,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The region echoes to the crash of arms:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Loose feathers from the encountering armies fly,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And in careering whirlwinds mount the sky.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To breathe from toil upsprings the panting crane,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then with fresh vigour downward darts again.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Success in equal balance hovering hangs.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Here, on the sharp spear, mad with mortal pangs,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The bird transfixed in bloody vortex whirls,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet fierce in death the threatening talon curls;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There, while the life-blood bubbles from his wound,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With little feet the pygmy beats the ground;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Deep from his breast the short, short sob he draws,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, dying, curses the keen-pointed claws.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Trembles the thundering field, thick covered o&#8217;er<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With falchions, mangled wings, and streaming gore,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And pygmy arms, and beaks of ample size;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And here a claw, and there a finger lies.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Encompassed round with heaps of slaughtered foes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All grim in blood the pygmy champion glows;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And on the assailing host impetuous springs,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Careless of nibbling bills, and flapping wings;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And midst the tumult wheresoe&#8217;er he turns,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The battle with redoubled fury burns.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From every side the avenging cranes, amain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Throng, to o&#8217;erwhelm this terror of the plain.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When suddenly (for such the will of Jove)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A fowl enormous, sousing from above,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The gallant chieftain clutched, and, soaring high,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(Sad chance of battle!) bore him up the sky.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The cranes pursue, and, clustering in a ring,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Chatter triumphant round the captive king.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But, ah! what pangs each pygmy bosom wrung,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When, now to cranes a prey, on talons hung,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">High in the clouds they saw their helpless lord,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His wriggling form still lessening as he soared!<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Lo! yet again, with unabated rage,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In mortal strife the mingling hosts engage.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The crane with darted bill assaults the foe,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hovering; then wheels aloft to scape the blow:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The dwarf in anguish aims the vengeful wound;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But whirls in empty air the falchion round.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Such was the scene, when midst the loud alarms<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sublime the eternal Thunderer rose in arms;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When Briareus, by mad ambition driven,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Heaved Pelion huge, and hurled it high at heaven.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Jove rolled redoubling thunders from on high,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Mountains and bolts encountered in the sky;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till one stupendous ruin whelmed the crew,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their vast limbs weltering wide in brimstone blue.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">But now at length the pygmy legions yield,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, winged with terror, fly the fatal field.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They raise a weak and melancholy wail,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All in distraction scattering o&#8217;er the vale.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Prone on their routed rear the cranes descend;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their bills bite furious, and their talons rend:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With unrelenting ire they urge the chace,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sworn to exterminate the hated race.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">&#8217;Twas thus the Pygmy Name, once great in war,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For spoils of conquered cranes renown&#8217;d afar,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Perished. For, by the dread decree of Heaven,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Short is the date to earthly grandeur given,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And vain are all attempts to roam beyond<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where Fate has fixed the everlasting bound.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fallen are the trophies of Assyrian power,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Persia&#8217;s proud dominion is no more;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yea, though to both superior far in fame,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thine empire, Latium! is an empty name.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And now, with lofty chiefs of antient time,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The pygmy heroes roam the Elysian clime.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or, if belief to matron-tales be due,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Full oft, in the belated shepherd&#8217;s view,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their frisking forms, in gentle green arrayed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gambol secure along the moonlight glade.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Secure, for no alarming cranes molest,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And all their woes in long oblivion rest;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Down the deep dale, and narrow winding way,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They foot it featly, ranged in ringlets gay:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&#8217;Tis joy and frolic all, where&#8217;er they rove,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Fairy-people is the name they love.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">But say, Is your&#8217;s without compare?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Look round the world; perhaps you&#8217;ll find<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Each individual of our kind<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pressed with an equal load of ill,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Equal at least. Look further still,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And own your lamentable case<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is little short of happiness.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In yonder hut, that stands alone,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Attend to Famine&#8217;s feeble moan;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or view the couch where Sickness lies;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Mark his pale cheek, and languid eyes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His frame by strong convulsion torn,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His struggling sighs, and looks forlorn.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or see, transfixed with keener pangs,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where o&#8217;er his hoard the miser hangs;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whistles the wind; he starts, he stares,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor Slumber&#8217;s balmy blessing shares;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Despair, Remorse, and Terror roll<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their tempests on his harassed soul.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">But here, perhaps, it may avail<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To enforce our reasoning with a tale.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Mild was the morn, the sky serene,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The jolly hunting band convene;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The beagle&#8217;s breast with ardour burns;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The bounding steed the champaign spurns;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And fancy oft the game descries<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Through the hound&#8217;s nose, and huntsman&#8217;s eyes.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Just then, a council of the hares<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had met, on national affairs.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">The chiefs were set; while o&#8217;er their head<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The furze its frizzled covering spread.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Long lists of grievances were heard,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And general discontent appeared.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&#8220;Our harmless race shall every savage,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&#8220;Both quadruped and biped, ravage?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&#8220;Shall horses, hounds, and hunters still<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&#8220;Unite their wits to work us ill?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&#8220;The youth, his parent&#8217;s sole delight,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&#8220;Whose tooth the dewy lawns invite,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&#8220;Whose pulse in every vein beats strong,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&#8220;Whose limbs leap light the vales along,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&#8220;May yet e&#8217;er noontide meet his death,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&#8220;And lie dismembered on the heath:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&#8220;For youth, alas! nor cautious age,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&#8220;Nor strength, nor speed, eludes their rage.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&#8220;In every field we meet the foe,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&#8220;Each gale comes fraught with sounds of woe:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&#8220;The morning but awakes our fears,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&#8220;The evening sees us bathed in tears.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">&#8220;But must we ever idly grieve,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&#8220;Nor strive our fortunes to relieve?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&#8220;Small is each individual force,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&#8220;To stratagem be our recourse;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&#8220;And then, from all our tribes combined,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&#8220;The murderer to his cost may find,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&#8220;No foe is weak, whom Justice arms,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&#8220;Whom Concord leads, and Hatred warms.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&#8220;Be roused; or liberty acquire,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&#8220;Or in the great attempt expire.&#8221;&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He said no more, for in his breast<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Conflicting thoughts the voice suppressed:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The fire of vengeance seemed to stream<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From his swoln eyeball&#8217;s yellow gleam.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And now the tumults of the war,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Mingling confusedly from afar,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Swell in the wind. Now louder cries,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Distinct, of hounds and men arise.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Forth from the brake, with beating heart,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Th&#8217; assembled hares tumultuous start,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, every straining nerve on wing,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Away precipitately spring.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The hunting band, a signal given,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thick thundering o&#8217;er the plain are driven;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O&#8217;er cliff abrupt, and shrubby mound,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And river broad, impetuous bound;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now plunge amid the forest shades,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Glance through the openings of the glades;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now o&#8217;er the level valley sweep,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now with short steps strain up the steep,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While backward from the hunter&#8217;s eyes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The landscape like a torrent flies.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At last an ancient wood they gained,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By pruner&#8217;s axe yet unprofaned.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">High o&#8217;er the rest, by Nature reared,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The oak&#8217;s majestic boughs appeared;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Beneath, a copse of various hue<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In barbarous luxuriance grew;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No knife had curbed the rambling sprays,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No hand had wove th&#8217; implicit maze.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">The flowering thorn, self-taught to wind,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The hazle&#8217;s stubborn stem intwined,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And bramble twigs were wreathed around,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And rough furze crept along the ground.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Here sheltering, from the sons of murther,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The hares drag their tired limbs no further.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">But, lo! the western wind erelong<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was loud, and roared the woods among:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From rustling leaves, and crashing boughs,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The sound of woe and war arose.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The hares, distracted, scour the grove,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As terror and amazement drove;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But danger, wheresoe&#8217;er they fled,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Still seemed impending o&#8217;er their head.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now crowded in a grotto&#8217;s gloom,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All hope extinct, they wait their doom:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dire was the silence, till, at length,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Even from despair deriving strength,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With bloody eye, and furious look,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A daring youth arose, and spoke.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i1">&#8220;O wretched race, the scorn of Fate,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&#8220;Whom ills of every sort await!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&#8220;O, cursed with keenest sense to feel<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&#8220;The sharpest sting of every ill!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&#8220;Say ye, who, fraught with mighty scheme,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&#8220;Of liberty and vengeance dream,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&#8220;What now remains? To what recess<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&#8220;Shall we our weary steps address,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&#8220;Since Fate is evermore pursuing<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&#8220;All ways and means to work our ruin?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&#8220;Are we alone, of all beneath,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&#8220;Condemned to misery worse than death!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&#8220;Must we, with fruitless labour, strive,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&#8220;In misery worse than death to live!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&#8220;No. Be the smaller ill our choice:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&#8220;So dictates Nature&#8217;s powerful voice.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&#8220;Death&#8217;s pang will in a moment cease;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&#8220;And then, All hail, eternal peace!&#8221;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thus while he spoke, his words impart<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The dire resolve to every heart.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i1">A distant lake in prospect lay,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That, glittering in the solar ray,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gleamed through the dusky trees, and shot<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A trembling light along the grot.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thither with one consent they bend,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their sorrows with their lives to end;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While each, in thought, already hears<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The water hissing in his ears,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Fast by the margin of the lake,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Concealed within a thorny brake,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A linnet sate, whose careless lay<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Amused the solitary day.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Careless he sung, for on his breast<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sorrow no lasting trace impressed;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When suddenly he heard a sound<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of swift feet traversing the ground.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Quick to the neighbouring tree he flies,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thence, trembling, casts around his eyes;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No foe appeared, his fears were vain;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pleased, he renews the sprightly strain.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i1">The hares, whose noise had caused his fright,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Saw, with surprise, the linnet&#8217;s flight.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is there on earth a wretch, they said,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whom our approach can strike with dread?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">An instantaneous change of thought<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To tumult every bosom wrought.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So fares the system-building sage,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who, plodding on from youth to age,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At last, on some foundation-dream,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Has reared aloft his goodly scheme,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And proved his predecessors fools,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And bound all nature by his rules;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So fares he, in that dreadful hour,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When injured truth exerts her power,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Some new phenomenon to raise;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which, bursting on his frighted gaze,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From its proud summit to the ground,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Proves the whole edifice unsound.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">&#8220;Children,&#8221; thus spake a hare sedate,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who oft had known the extremes of Fate,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">&#8220;In slight events the attentive mind<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&#8220;May hints of good instruction find.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&#8220;That our condition is the worst,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&#8220;And we with such misfortunes cursed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&#8220;As all comparison defy,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&#8220;Was late the universal cry.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&#8220;When, lo! an accident so slight,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&#8220;As yonder little linnet&#8217;s flight,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&#8220;Has made your stubborn hearts confess<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&#8220;(So your amazement bids me guess)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&#8220;That all our load of woes and fears<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&#8220;Is but a part of what he bears.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&#8220;Where can he rest secure from harms,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&#8220;Whom even a helpless hare alarms?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&#8220;Yet he repines not at his lot;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&#8220;When past, his dangers are forgot:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&#8220;On yonder bough he trims his wings,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&#8220;And with unusual rapture sings;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&#8220;While we, less wretched, sink beneath<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&#8220;Our lighter ills, and rush to death.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">&#8220;No more of this unmeaning rage,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&#8220;But hear, my friends, the word of age:<br /></span>
<span class="i1">&#8220;When, by the winds of autumn driven,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&#8220;The scattered clouds fly cross the heaven,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&#8220;Oft have we, from some mountain&#8217;s head,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&#8220;Beheld the alternate light and shade<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&#8220;Sweep the long vale. Here, hovering, lowers<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&#8220;The shadowy cloud; there, downward pours,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&#8220;Streaming direct, a flood of day,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&#8220;Which from the view flies swift away;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&#8220;It flies, while other shades advance,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&#8220;And other streaks of sunshine glance.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&#8220;Thus chequered is the life below<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&#8220;With gleams of joy, and clouds of woe.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&#8220;Then hope not, while we journey on,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&#8220;Still to be basking in the sun;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&#8220;Nor fear, though now in shades ye mourn,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&#8220;That sunshine will no more return.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&#8220;If, by your terrors overcome,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&#8220;Ye fly before the approaching gloom,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">&#8220;The rapid clouds your flight pursue,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&#8220;And darkness still o&#8217;ercasts your view.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&#8220;Who longs to reach the radiant plain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&#8220;Must onward urge his course amain;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&#8220;For doubly swift the shadow flies,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&#8220;When &#8217;gainst the gale the pilgrim plies.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&#8220;At least be firm, and undismayed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&#8220;Maintain your ground; the fleeting shade,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&#8220;Erelong, spontaneous glides away,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&#8220;And gives you back the enlivening ray.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&#8220;Lo! while I speak, our danger past!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&#8220;No more the shrill horn&#8217;s angry blast<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&#8220;Howls in our ear; the savage roar<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&#8220;Of war and murder is no more.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&#8220;Then snatch the hour that Fate allows,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&#8220;Nor think of past and future woes.&#8221;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He spoke; and hope revives; the lake<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That instant, one and all forsake,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In sweet amusement to employ<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The present sprightly hour of joy.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i1">Now, from the western mountain&#8217;s brow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Compassed with clouds of various glow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The sun a broader orb displays,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And shoots aslope his ruddy rays.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The lawn assumes a fresher green,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And dew-drops spangle all the scene.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The balmy zephyr breathes along,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The shepherd sings his tender song.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With all their lays the groves resound,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And falling waters murmur round;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Discord and care were put to flight,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And all was peace, and calm delight.<br /></span>
